### ML Ideas:
- Classification with logistic regression (fraud/not fraud)
- Clustering with k-means vs DBSCAN -> which performs better?
    - Cluster categories of purchases
- Trends to look out for:
    - Time of purchase
        - Look at single user at a time
        - Fraudulent purchases might be in middle of the night and/or very close together (thatâ€™s 2 figures right there)
        - **I have done this in another class in case she doesn't teach it**

### Will:
- Data cleaning
    - Verify correct data types/handling missing values
    - Scaling and normalization
    - Parse dates
- Pie charts
    - Type of purchase used for fraud
    - Age of fraudster

### Ethan
- Histograms:
    - Data used:
        - Date
    - number of fraud transactions by year, month
    - *Even/Odd number placement -> Valid Credit card*

### Cinzia
- Maps/Geographical findings
    - Data used:
        - Latitude
        - Longitude
        - City population
    - Heatmap of fraud hotspots
    - Population heatmap
    - Plot a Map with Red = fraud, green = valid purchase

### Maddie
- Lists (top X)
    - Data used:
        - Date
        - Category
        - Transaction amount
        - *Job of card holder*
    - Time of day bracket (we customize that ourselves)
    - Transaction category
    - Amount bracket (we customize that ourselves)
    - *Tax bracket? (ask her about this using job of credit card holder)*
